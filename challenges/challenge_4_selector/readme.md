# Selector

## Challenge

Change the color of all anchors on hover to red in the unordered list with a class listRight that is a child of the container. Use the nesting and the & selector.

Your challenge is to change the color of all anchor elements that fulfil the following criteria:

    The anchor is part of an unordered list
    The anchor has a class called listRight
    The anchor is a child of an element which has a class called container

The anchor element should change to the color red when a user hovers over it. Use the nesting and the & selector to achieve this effect.

Use the hint tab to access the boilerplate files. The elements you want to target are included in the index.html file.
